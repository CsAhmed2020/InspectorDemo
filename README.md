# InspectorDemo
The legend says any technical bugs look for the back-end 
But client and the testers don't admit it. 
So,as a mobile dev we don't need to ask for a token and go to Postman to determine the issue point. 
The inspectors are here to save time and effort.
# As an android developer take a look at :
*  [HttpLoggingInterceptor] that used to print logs during network requests.
*  [Chucker] that simplifies the inspection of HTTP(S) requests/responses fired by your Android App in Simple clear UI.

# As a flutter developer to go with same behavior  take a look at  :
* [LogInterceptor]
* [RequestsInspectorInterceptor]
